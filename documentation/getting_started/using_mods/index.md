# Where do I find mods?
Most mods are hosted on Thunderstore: **[timberborn.thunderstore.io](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io)**

There's also a showcase of some the developer recommended mods here:  
[Steam Showcase](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/3137323790645839943)
* Please note that Mods are not officially supported yet

# Mod Managers
Either of these lets you easily install mods. Unfortunately only support windows (for now)
1. [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
2. [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager)

You can use these to install any mods, and it will install all dependencies for you. Most mods require BepInEx and TimberAPI.
